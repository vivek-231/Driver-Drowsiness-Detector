# 🚗 Driver Drowsiness Detection System (Full Stack + Computer Vision)

A real-time driver drowsiness detection system built using Python, OpenCV, and Tkinter.  
The system monitors eye closure using Haar Cascade classifiers and triggers alerts when drowsiness is detected.

## 🔍 Features
- Real-time face and eye detection
- Drowsiness detection using eye-closure logic
- Audio alert system for safety
- Simple GUI using Tkinter
- Lightweight and runs on standard webcam

## 🧠 Tech Stack
- Python  
- OpenCV  
- Tkinter  
- Haar Cascade Classifiers  

## 🏗️ Project Architecture
Webcam → Frame Capture → Face Detection → Eye Detection → Drowsiness Logic → Alert + GUI

## ⚙️ Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/driver-drowsiness-detection.git
